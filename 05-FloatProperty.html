		Floating
		========
		none = dafault
		inherit = take from parent 
		left / right : floats element in direction

		// NOTE: text automatically flows around the element 
		// removes element from document flow and pushes it to the far of the the direction
		// other elements still respond to the width and the height of the element

		clearing
		========
		// If you don't want the text to flow around the floated objects you use the clear property
		// you normally clear to the direction of the float, e.g. if 'greenbox' is floated left you clear the prargraph left. 
		// you can also clear in both directions

He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety. At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones. As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff</p>
